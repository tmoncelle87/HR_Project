# C_Sharp_Practice
# This project is a great way to gather information needed for hr document filing. The document stores and organizes information like employer, HR and employee contact information. The document also contains quite a bit of information about the employee including yearly pay, position, performance review and much more. I have experienced some struggle building this project. For example there were many moments after I implemented something big that I found out there was a better way to do it and had to revise a lot of code. This project utilizes oop,  databases, and gui, and writes to multiple file types.
